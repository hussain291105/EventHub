# Production Deployment Fix Summary

## Problems Fixed

### 1. ❌ API 404 Errors
**Error**: `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 () api/events`

**Cause**: Frontend was making requests to relative URLs (`/api/events`) which don't work in production when frontend and backend are deployed separately.

**Fix**: Updated `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` to use `VITE_API_URL` environment variable to prefix all API requests with the backend URL.

### 2. ❌ JSON Parse Error
**Error**: `SyntaxError: Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': Unexpected end of JSON input`

**Cause**: When API requests fail (404), the server returns HTML error pages instead of JSON, causing JSON parsing to fail.

**Fix**: Same as above - once API requests go to the correct backend URL, they will return proper JSON responses.

### 3. ❌ CORS Configuration
**Issue**: Hardcoded frontend URL in CORS configuration wouldn't work for different deployments.

**Fix**: Updated `server/index.ts` to use `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable for dynamic CORS configuration.

## Files Changed

### 1. `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts`
- Added `API_BASE_URL` constant that reads from `VITE_API_URL` environment variable
- Updated `apiRequest()` function to prepend base URL to all requests
- Updated `getQueryFn()` to prepend base URL to query key URLs

### 2. `server/index.ts`
- Changed CORS configuration to use `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable
- Added dynamic origin checking with better error logging

### 3. New Files Created
- `.env.example` - Template for environment variables
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide
- `RENDER_SETUP.md` - Quick step-by-step Render deployment guide
- `FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## What You Need to Do Now

### On Render (Backend Web Service)

Add these environment variables:
```
DATABASE_URL=<your-postgres-url>
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your-stripe-secret>
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your-stripe-publishable>
ENABLE_MOCK_PAYMENTS=false
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=production
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-url.onrender.com
```

### On Render (Frontend Static Site)

Add these environment variables:
```
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.onrender.com
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=<your-stripe-publishable-key>
```

### Deploy Steps

1. **Commit and push these changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix production API and CORS configuration"
   git push
   ```

2. **Add environment variables** in Render dashboard for both services

3. **Redeploy** both frontend and backend (or wait for auto-deploy)

4. **Test** by opening your frontend URL and checking browser console

## Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Frontend loads without errors
- [ ] Browser console shows no 404 errors on `/api/events`
- [ ] Browser console shows no CORS errors
- [ ] Events page loads and displays events
- [ ] Can create new events (if you have organizer access)
- [ ] Can view event details
- [ ] Booking flow works

## How to Debug

### Check Frontend Logs
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for API request URLs - they should start with your backend URL

### Check Backend Logs
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Open your backend web service
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Look for:
   - CORS warnings
   - API request logs
   - Error messages

### Test API Directly
Open in browser: `https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/api/events`
- Should return JSON array of events
- Should NOT return 404 or HTML error page

## Local Development

No changes needed for local development! The code works with or without `VITE_API_URL`:
- **Without** `VITE_API_URL`: Uses relative URLs (works with Vite dev proxy)
- **With** `VITE_API_URL`: Uses absolute URLs (works with deployed backend)

Just run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
